1 Steps to deploy an OS in VirtualBox:

Install VirtualBox
Create a new VM
Configure settings (RAM, HDD)
Add OS ISO image
Start VM and install OS

2 Hardware limitations for 32- and 64-bit OS:

32-bit OS works on any processor
64-bit OS requires x86-64 support and VT-x/AMD-V enabled in BIOS/UEFI

3 Steps to install Linux in text mode:

Boot from installation media
Partition the disk
Select components
Configure network
Install and boot

4 Installing Gnome and KDE in Linux:

Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install gnome kde-plasma-desktop

CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum groupinstall "GNOME Desktop" "KDE Plasma Workspaces"

5 Xfce & Fvwm:

Xfce – lightweight, Windows-like interface
Fvwm – minimalist, highly customizable

 __Control Questions__
6 Hypervisors Type 1 & Type 2:

Type 1 (bare-metal) – runs directly on hardware (ESXi, Hyper-V)
Type 2 (hosted) – runs within an OS (VirtualBox, VMware Workstation)

7 GNU GPL:

License allowing free use, modification, and distribution of software

8 Open-source software:

Code is publicly available for modification and distribution

9 What is a Linux distribution?

Linux OS + utilities, drivers, package manager (Ubuntu, Debian, Arch)

10 System administration tasks in Linux:

User management, networking, security, backups

11 Connection between Android & Linux:

Android is based on the Linux kernel

12 Embedded Linux:

Lightweight Linux for IoT, embedded devices (routers, smart TVs)

13 Changing Linux boot mode

Text mode:

systemctl set-default multi-user.target

Graphical mode:

systemctl set-default graphical.target

CLI – command-line interface, minimal resource usage
GUI – graphical interface, user-friendly

__Conclusions__
VirtualBox allows easy OS deployment with proper VM setup and hardware configuration. 32-bit OS works on any CPU, while 64-bit requires VT-x/AMD-V support.
Linux text-mode installation is manual and suited for servers, with graphical environments like Gnome, KDE, Xfce, and Fvwm offering different experiences. 
Type 1 hypervisors run directly on hardware, while Type 2 runs within an OS. GNU GPL ensures free software modification and distribution, supporting open-source development. 
Android is based on Linux, and Embedded Linux is widely used in IoT and smart devices.
